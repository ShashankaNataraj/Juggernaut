## Yet another text editor?
I've used emacs(with and without spacemacs), vim, WebStorm, and everything in between. I keep coming back to webstorm due to 1 reason: The features the IDE provides is amazing. But WebStorm is a resource hog. 

Since I work on 3D applications, I need every ounce of juice my editor can spare me.

So I set out to write a lightweight and fast editor that isn't a resource hog but still gives me the most

## Why not VSCode?
https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/49161

## Why even compete with established editors out there?
There are many editors out there, but this one is mine. And, I can learn Rust when implementing it ^_^

## Objectives in order of priority
- Fast
- Predictable
- Rock Solid
- Modal based
- Lightweight
- Aesthetics
- Completely keyboard driven navigation for non vim emulated operations
- 0 telemetry

## Start Developing
Run `cargo watch -x run` to allow cargo to watch for changes and live reload

Run `webpack --watch` to allow webpack to look for UI changes and live reload

## But, but, electron is cancerÂ®
That is exactly why this project uses https://github.com/Boscop/web-view xD
