## Yet another text editor?
Ive used emacs(with and without spacemacs), vim, webstorm, and everything in between. I keep coming back to webstorm due to 1 reason: The features the IDE provides is amazing. But webstorm is a resource hog. 

Since I work on 3D applications, I need every ounce of juice my editor can spare me.

So I set out to write a lightweight and fast editor that isnt a resource hog

## Why not VSCode?
